Homework 4:

Design decisions:
=================
I have followed specifications and not made any deviating design decisions.

I have designed 3 algorithms:

1. Union find and I looked up Wikipedia for Pseudo code but the entire implementation was my own and from scratch.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure

2. Breadth first search:
I looked up Wikipedia for Pseudo code but the entire implementation was my own and from scratch.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search

3.Dijkstra's:
I looked up Wikipedia for Pseudo code but the entire implementation was my own and from scratch.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm

I have anyways cited it in my code.

Description:
============
In this homework I have implemented:
	1>Mazegeneration using Union find
	2>Mazesolve using BFS(type1) and Dijkstra's(Type2)

Assumptions: 
===========
- I have assumed that in "mazegen" you cannot specify commands like:
	hw4 mazegen 10 4 -top=3 -top=2
or  hw4 mazegen 10 4 -right=2 -right=4

Since i beleive that by definition of unix options you cannot specify a same type option twice.
However this will work for mazesolve in case the start and the end is on the same side of the wall.


-	If -DDEBUG0 or -DDEBUG1 or DDEBUG2 or DDEBUG3 or DDEBUG4 is enabled in makefile then the output is verbose and is solely for my own testing. 
	Please **DO NOT** ENABLE these flags in makefile

References:
===========

-I have referenced wikipedia 3 times to look at the algorithm however did not copy any code rather wrote my own.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm

-I have used the util.cpp from my previous homework hw3 which contains a lot of code like checking if a file
has access permissions etc. and even simple utilities that were hand written by me like atod, etc.
Note: that util.cpp are also uploaded in my github account ///< github.com/chetanankola
