Homework 3:

Design decisions:
=================
I have followed specifications and not made any deviating design decisions.
I only have BST insertion and deletion working. 
AVL is not working still



Files included in submission: 
============================
main.cpp
main.hpp
cs570.h
my570BST.cpp
my570BST.hpp
Makefile
README
util.cpp
util.hpp
BST.cpp
BST.hpp
AVL.cpp
AVL.hpp


Description:
============
In this homework I have implemented:
	1>BST
	2>AVL Tree [Incomplete]

Assumptions: 
===========
-	
-	If -DDEBUG0 or -DDEBUG1 is enabled in makefile then the output is verbose and is solely for my own testing. 
	Please **DO NOT** ENABLE these flags in makefile
