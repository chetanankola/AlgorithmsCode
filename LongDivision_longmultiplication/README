Homework 1:

Design decisions:
=================
I have followed specifications and not made any deviating design decisions.
I created a small test suite which does not run with the real code unless a -DDEBUG0 is enabled as a flag for all compilations 


Files included in submission: 
============================
/headers
	mul.h
	div.h
	main.h
/src
	mul.c
	div.c
	main.c
/test
	test.h
	test.c
README
Makefile	




Description:
============
This program performs long multiplication and long division.
the mul.c file contains code for multiplication and it also performs the display operations.
the div.c file contains code for division and it also performas its own display operations.
The main.c contains the code which checks for invalid arguments etc.and calls the relevant function in mul.c or div.c depending on the command.

The test.c functions are called if DEBUG0 is enabled in MAKE , in which case calling hw1 -T0  or hw -T1 or hw -T2 runs a regression tests for some multiplication and division cases.


Assumptions:
===========
I have made no assumptions in this assignment and have strictly followed the specification.
I have run the scripts given by the professor and all the cases run fine without any diff errors.


References:
===========
None
