Homework 2:

Design decisions:
=================
I have followed specifications and not made any deviating design decisions.
***	I have not implemented Display YET {INCOMPLETE} but have handled command line arguments for display program

I have used strtok to split strings in sort function.
I have used recursion to print the directory.



Files included in submission: 
============================
main.cpp
main.hpp
display.cpp
display.hpp
sort.cpp
sort.hpp
my570list.cpp
Makefile
README
cs570.h
my570list.hpp


Description:
============
In this homework I have implemented:
	1>List
	2>Sort

Assumptions: 
===========
-	If the file is empty then the program exits saying "Input/File is empty" for hw2 sort
-	If -DDEBUG0 or -DDEBUG1 is enabled in makefile then the output is verbose and is solely for my own testing. 
	Please **DO NOT** ENABLE these flags in makefile
